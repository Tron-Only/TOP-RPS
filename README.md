*When keeping it console goes right*

Welcome to the **Most Dramatic Console-Based Rock Paper Scissors Simulator of 2025** (disclaimer: drama not included). Created for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) because apparently we needed another RPS game in the world.

## Features ‚ú®

- **100% Less Hand Injuries** than real-life rock paper scissors  
- **Console Magic** - It's like the 80s never left!  
- **Sassy AI Opponent** (okay fine, it's just basic conditional logic)  
- **No Microtransactions** (take that, modern gaming industry!)  
- **Viking Approved** üõ°Ô∏è‚öîÔ∏è (Odin himself may or may not have beta tested this)

## Installation ‚ö°

1. **Summon the code from the digital void:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tron-Only/TOP-RPS.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the sacred directory:**
   ```bash
   cd TOP-RPS
   ```
3. **Initiate the ancient ritual:**<br>
   Just use the LiveServer extension or open it using the browser(like an animal)<br>

   Open VSCode and type `ctrl+P`, type `ext install ritwickdey.liveserver`.

   *(Yes, we're using JavaScript. No, we won't be taking questions at this time)*

## How to Play üéÆ

1. Prepare your battle cry (optional but recommended)  
2. Type `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` like you mean it  
3. Discover if the computer really is out to get you  
4. Repeat until you achieve enlightenment or rage quit  

## Contributing ü§ù

Got ideas? Fantastic! Here's how to proceed:

1. Write your contribution on parchment using a quill  
2. Whisper it to a USB drive under a full moon  
3. Submit a PR and hope the code gods are merciful  

*(Alternatively, just fork and submit a normal PR. We accept bribes in coffee form ‚òï)*

## License üìú

**MIT License** - Do whatever you want with this code, just don't blame me if your computer starts judging your life choices.
